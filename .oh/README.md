# .oh/

**OpenHarness's own machinery, grouped as one addressable unit.** The `oh` CLI,
the installer/lifecycle scripts, the container-install inputs, and the
deploy/compose config now live together here so a future version (and the `oh`
CLI itself) can address the harness's machinery as a single namespace instead of
hunting it across the repo root.

This rescopes the removed `.openharness/` deploy-override directory under the
short name that already matches the `oh` CLI (so `.openharness/` nested inside the
`openharness` repo is no longer redundant), and extends it from "just deploy
config" to "the machinery."

## Governing principle: a dotdir namespace is earned by FUNCTION-CLASS

This **supersedes** the earlier "earned by EXPORT only" rule. Two peer machinery
namespaces, split by what *kind* of thing they hold:

- **`.mifune/`** — provider-portable *primitives* (skills, agents, hooks),
  exported to the four agent providers via symlinks (`.claude/`, `.codex/`,
  `.pi/`, `.hermes/`).
- **`.oh/`** — *OpenHarness's own machinery* as one unit: the `oh` CLI (`cli/`),
  the Docusaurus docs-site builder (`docs/`, the sole pnpm-workspace member),
  installer + lifecycle scripts (`scripts/`), container-install inputs
  (`install/`), and user-local deploy config (`config.json`). The former
  top-level `packages/` folder was **retired** — its `oh` and `docs` packages
  moved in here.
- **repo root** — everything forced to root by *external* tooling
  (`.devcontainer/` for the devcontainer spec + Docker COPY, `harness.yaml`,
  `package.json`, `pnpm-*.yaml`, `.github/`, `.husky/`) **plus** live
  identity/state the harness edits in place (`context/`, `evals/`, `crons/`,
  `memory/`, `tasks/`, `workspace/`, and the markdown `docs/`+`blog/` content
  the `.oh/docs` site renders).

### Back-compat symlinks (the `.mifune` precedent)

The runtime-machinery directories (`scripts/`, `install/`) moved into `.oh/` but
keep **tracked back-compat symlinks at the old root paths** — exactly how
`.claude/skills` → `.mifune/skills` works:

| Old path (symlink) | Real location |
|---|---|
| `scripts/` | `.oh/scripts/` |
| `install/` | `.oh/install/` |

Every consumer pinning those literals — the ~7 skills and 2 cron bodies that call
`scripts/locked-append.sh`, the `Makefile`'s `COMPOSE := scripts/docker-compose.sh`,
the boot-lint shellcheck glob (`scripts/*.sh`), vitest's `scripts/__tests__/**`,
and the eval probes — keeps resolving through the symlink unchanged. Boot scripts
that self-resolve via `cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd` land on the repo root through
the symlink (bash logical `pwd`), so no path-resolution rewiring was needed.

The **package** directories (`cli/`, `docs/`) moved *without* a back-compat
symlink — the `packages/` folder is retired, and their consumers were repointed
directly to the real `.oh/` paths:

- **`npm --prefix packages/oh`** → `npm --prefix .oh/cli` (CI typecheck + release).
- **pnpm workspace** — `pnpm-workspace.yaml` now declares `.oh/docs`; the
  `pnpm --filter './packages/**'` selectors became `--filter './.oh/**'`, and the
  `docs:build`/`docs:dev`/`docs:serve` scripts use `--dir .oh/docs`.
- **Docker `COPY`** (`.oh/devcontainer/Dockerfile`) — copies from `.oh/cli/` and
  `.oh/install/` (Docker's build context ignores symlinked directories anyway).
- **GitHub Actions `paths:` filters** — keyed on real diff paths, so `.oh/**` was
  added to `ci-harness.yml`/`sandbox-boot-guard.yml` and `docs.yml`'s filter +
  `working-directory` repointed to `.oh/docs`. (The legacy `scripts/**` /
  `install/**` / `packages/oh/**` filters are kept so the path probes stay green.)


## How Mifune is added

The core runtime expects `.mifune/` to be initialized before provider paths read shared skills, agents, hooks, or evals. `.mifune/` is a pinned Git submodule from `https://github.com/ryaneggz/mifune.git`; `.oh/scripts/ensure-mifune.sh --init` initializes or repairs it, and `--check` verifies the URL, pinned SHA, protected paths, executable bits, provider symlinks, and Hermes link when enabled.

`.pi/` remains the Pi provider surface in v1. It is not the Mifune submodule mount in this PR.

## Contents

| File / dir | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | This file — the namespace anchor (keeps `.oh/` in a fresh clone) and the surface's documentation. |
| `cli/` | The in-tree `oh` CLI (standalone npm package; built into the image as `/opt/oh`). Old path: `packages/oh/` (no symlink — repointed). |
| `install/` | Container-install inputs (`.zshrc`, `.tmux.conf`, `banner.sh`, `install.sh` prerequisites) consumed by the Dockerfile + entrypoint. Old path: `install/` (back-compat symlink kept). |
| `scripts/` | Installer, lifecycle, cron-runtime, and eval-support scripts (`docker-compose.sh`, `cron-runtime.ts`, `ralph.sh`, `locked-append.sh`, `harness-config.sh`, …). Old path: `scripts/` (back-compat symlink kept). |
| `patches/` | Vendored pnpm dependency patches (applied at install via `package.json` `patchedDependencies`). |
| `config.json` | User-local, gitignored `composeOverrides[]` source. Read here first; legacy repo-root `config.json` is honored as a fallback. |

## oh init (Phase 2)

`oh init [dir]` scaffolds a fresh harness checkout (defaulting to the current
directory) by materializing the payload under `.oh/templates/` — `harness.yaml`,
`AGENTS.md`, a `gitignore` seed, and a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` whose
`workspaceFolder` is pinned to `/home/sandbox/project`. The command is
`runInit` (exported from `cli/src/commands/init.ts`, dispatched from `cli.ts`).

A `--templates <dir>` escape hatch points the command at an alternate template
source instead of the bundled `.oh/templates/`.

**Deferred slices** (Phase 2 slice 2/3, not in this slice):

- **Installed-binary template bundling** — the on-PATH `oh` resolves templates
  to `/opt/templates`, which the `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` does **not** COPY
  yet, so the installed binary has no payload to read. Until then, run `oh init`
  from a built checkout (where `.oh/templates/` resolves locally) or pass
  `--templates <dir>` explicitly.
- **Live-asset restructure** — promoting the template set from a static seed to
  the live harness assets.
- **Full `.oh/` vendoring** — shipping the complete `.oh/` machinery as part of
  the scaffold.

## What belongs here vs. at root

| Belongs in `.oh/` | Stays at root |
|------|------|
| OpenHarness's own machinery addressed as a unit: the `oh` CLI, the docs-site builder, installer/lifecycle scripts, container-install inputs, deploy/compose config | Surfaces **forced to root by external tooling** (`.devcontainer/`, `harness.yaml`, `package.json`, `pnpm-*.yaml`, `.github/`, `.husky/`) and **live identity/state** edited in place (`context/`, `evals/`, `crons/`, `memory/`, `tasks/`, `workspace/`, and the `docs/`+`blog/` markdown content) |

### Why these specifically stay at root

- `.devcontainer/` — now a **thin compat layer**, not the build machinery. It
  holds only the VS Code `devcontainer.json` (GENERATED by
  `.oh/scripts/sync-devcontainer.sh` — do not hand-edit) and the user-owned `.env`,
  pinned to root by the devcontainer spec / `.dockerignore` / hadolint (which don't
  honor a symlinked directory). The actual build assets (`Dockerfile`,
  `docker-compose.yml` + the hermes-dashboard overlay, `entrypoint.sh`, and the two
  client scripts `client-slack-supervise.sh` / `seed-msg-bridge.sh`) now live at
  `.oh/devcontainer/`.
- `docs/` + `blog/` — the markdown **content** (vs. the `.oh/docs` Docusaurus site
  that renders it); the Docusaurus config reaches them via `../../docs` /
  `../../blog`, which resolves identically because `.oh/docs` sits at the same
  depth `packages/docs` did.
- `harness.yaml` — the CI path filters and the `autopilot-preflight-gate` /
  `harness-ci-core-paths` / `sandbox-boot-guard-ci` probes pin it at repo root.
- `config.json` — relocated *logically* to `.oh/config.json` (now the canonical
  read location); the gitignored file itself is user-local runtime state, and the
  legacy repo-root path still works as a fallback for older installs.

## Project-root seam

`OH_PROJECT_ROOT` (default `/home/sandbox/harness`) is the single source of truth for
the container workspace path. All devcontainer and `.oh/scripts` consumers derive their
paths from `${OH_PROJECT_ROOT:-/home/sandbox/harness}` rather than the bare literal.
`HARNESS` is kept as a back-compat alias (`HARNESS="${HARNESS:-$OH_PROJECT_ROOT}"`);
prefer `$OH_PROJECT_ROOT` in new code. This is Phase 1 of [#531](https://github.com/mifunedev/openharness/issues/531) toward `oh init`.
The seam contract is guarded by `evals/probes/project-root-seam.sh`.

## devcontainer layout (Phase 2 slice 2)

The harness's own devcontainer build assets were relocated from top-level
`.devcontainer/` into **`.oh/devcontainer/`** so the boot machinery rides along
with the rest of the `.oh/` control plane. The split is:

- **`.oh/devcontainer/`** — the build/bootstrap assets: `Dockerfile`,
  `docker-compose.yml` + the `docker-compose.hermes-dashboard.yml` overlay,
  `entrypoint.sh`, `client-slack-supervise.sh`, `seed-msg-bridge.sh`. The CI
  hadolint/shellcheck boot-lint, the `.oh/scripts` lifecycle wrappers, and the
  `dockerComposeFile` reference all point here.
- **root `.devcontainer/`** — a thin compat layer only: the VS Code
  `devcontainer.json` (GENERATED by `.oh/scripts/sync-devcontainer.sh`, repointed
  at `../.oh/devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`) plus the user-owned `.env`. It is
  pinned to root by the devcontainer spec / `.dockerignore` / hadolint.

This is a no-behavior-change relocation validated by the sandbox boot-guard. It
is **separate** from `.oh/templates/.devcontainer/` (Phase 2 slice 1), which is the
downstream scaffold copied into *consumer* repos by the `oh` CLI — not this repo's
own boot environment.

## oh update (Phase 3)

`oh update` upgrades **only the `.oh/` control plane** of an OpenHarness-equipped
repo. It is the **sibling of `oh init`**: where `oh init` seeds *project* files
from `.oh/templates/`, `oh update` refreshes the `.oh/` **infrastructure itself**.
Project source — anything *outside* `.oh/` — is left untouched.

**Usage:**

```bash
oh update --from <dir> [--dry-run] [--force]
```

- `--from <built-checkout>` — the source `.oh/` to upgrade from. This is the MVP
  source surface; **remote-fetch is DEFERRED** (the same precedent as `oh init`'s
  deferred bundling — a built source must be supplied via `--from` in this slice).
- `--dry-run` — report what would change without writing.
- `--force` — override the version gate (see below).

**Safety invariant:** `oh update` writes **only under `<target>/.oh/`**, and every
write path is **path-escape-guarded** (rejected if it would resolve outside
`<target>/.oh/`). Because of this, "project source remains untouched" holds **by
construction** — only files *outside* `.oh/` are guaranteed untouched.

**Version gate:** the version is read from `.oh/cli/package.json#version` — there
is **no separate VERSION file**. `oh update` **no-ops when already current**, and
**refuses a downgrade without `--force`**.

> **Honesty disclosure:** in this MVP, `oh update` **OVERWRITES `.oh/` files in
> place with NO backup**. Any user-modified file *under* `.oh/` (for example a
> local `.oh/config.json`) **is replaced**. Only files **outside** `.oh/` (the
> project source) are guaranteed untouched.

**Contrast with `oh init`:** `oh init` *seeds project files* from `.oh/templates/`
into the repo; `oh update` *refreshes the `.oh/` infrastructure* in place. Do not
confuse the two — init populates the project, update upgrades the control plane.

## Payload manifest

`oh update` does **not** overlay all of `.oh/`. It overlays a **declared
allowlist** read from `.oh/manifest.json` — an `{ "include": [...], "exclude":
[...] }` document whose globs are **POSIX paths relative to `.oh/`** (e.g.
`cli/**`, `README.md`, `manifest.json`). A path ships **iff** it matches at least
one `include` pattern and zero `exclude` patterns (exclude wins).

**What is intentionally NOT shipped:** `.oh/patches/` (repo-specific dependency
patches) is **omitted from `include`**, so it is never vendored into a consumer
repo. It is **not deleted** — it stays physically in this repo; it is simply not
part of the payload. (The Docusaurus docs site formerly under `.oh/docs/` has been
migrated out to [`mifunedev/openharness-web`](https://github.com/mifunedev/openharness-web).)

- **The manifest ships itself** — `manifest.json` is in `include`, so the policy
  **propagates forward**: a consumer's next `oh update` reads the *source's*
  manifest and inherits the same boundary.
- `templates/**` is pre-declared in `include` for PR #334 (the `oh init`
  templates); on this base it matches **nothing**, harmlessly.

**Back-compat (legacy mode):** a source with **no `.oh/manifest.json`** — or an
empty/invalid one — falls back to overlaying **all of `.oh/`**, exactly as
before, emitting a one-line `legacy mode` warning so the fallback stays visible.

**Boundary is preserved:** the manifest **cannot reach outside `.oh/`**. Its
patterns are relative to `.oh/`, and the existing path-escape guard (writes land
only under `<target>/.oh/`) is **unchanged** — the manifest *narrows* the
payload, it never widens the write surface. Cross-tree shipping of
`.mifune/skills` is **deferred** (out of scope here).

> **`oh init` seam:** `oh init` does **not** yet honor this manifest — its
> manifest-aware seeding (`commands/init.ts`) and the `.oh/templates/` payload
> ship in PR #334. Today the manifest governs `oh update` only.
